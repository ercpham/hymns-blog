*I will be glad and exult in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.*  
**Psalm 9:2 (ESV)**

God, to You, we lift our praise  
For lost and sinking we should be.  
At Your word, the dead are raised  
And men are lifted from the sea

Now, we seek to share the truth  
that others may be lifted too.  
We are stewards of this word  
with power to give life anew.

Beautiful the feet of those  
who run into the darkest night.  
Great rewards await the saints  
who give their lives to shine the light

May the Lamb receive the prize  
for which he suffered, bled, and died.  
People of all tribes and tongues  
shall bow and lift His name on high
