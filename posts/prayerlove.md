*In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.*  
**1 John 4:10 (ESV)**

I do not get what I deserve.  
Because of this, I sing.  
While I was lost and dead in sin,  
the Savior died for me.

Behold my Savior's lavish love!  
Unfathomable grace  
is why I'm raised with Him who lives  
and I will see His face.

Oh Father, let me know it more,  
this love that has been shown,  
that I may love You totally  
and in Your graces grow.

Control my heart, my soul, my strength.  
It all belongs to you.  
Ignite a fire to obey  
your statutes, ever true.

Please grow my love for Your redeemed,  
these others whom you've loved.  
May I abound in gracious care  
and point them straight above.

Let me forgive, for I have been  
forgiven of much more.  
May I recall the love of Christ  
and love forevermore.
