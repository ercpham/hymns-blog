*Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!*  
**Romans 11:33 (ESV)**

Almighty God of wisdom,  
Who can know Your ways?  
Who can answer back,  
To the Ancient of all days?

Unsearchable your judgments.  
Righteous your decrees.  
Sovereign over all,  
You will do all that You please.

It pleased you, Lord to crush Him:  
Your begotten Son.  
Worship the Messiah,  
For the will of God is done

You have foreknown your people  
They are your elect  
They are now secure,  
But the sinners you reject.

You are the righteous potter  
We are just the clay  
You deserve our praise  
Every night and every day.

In love, we have been chosen.  
By the gracious king.  
By your grace alone.  
We shall glorify and sing.
