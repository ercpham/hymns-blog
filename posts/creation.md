*O Lord, how manifold are your works! In wisdom have you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.*  
**Psalm 104:24 (ESV)**

The sunlight shines upon the land and sea.  
I’m moved to worship as I wake again.  
I praise you, Lord, for You have made it all!  
My song to you will never find its end!

What grace that I’ve been granted one more day!  
Let this one too, be offered up to you  
I rise to fall upon my knees and pray.  
For its by grace that I have strength to move.

To think, that all creation is accursed!  
The thought can only bring me deeper peace  
‘Cause if what’s cursed can glorify you so,  
The new creation will not ever cease.
