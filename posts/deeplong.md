*You have said, “Seek my face.” My heart says to you, “Your face, Lord, do I seek.”*  
**Psalm 27:8 (ESV)**

You know my deepest longing  
and my every way.  
You alone can satisfy and  
answer all I pray

I do not pray for riches  
nor seek vanity,  
but I pray that I behold the  
face of Christ my King

Reveal to me your kindness.  
Move me to repent.  
Let me know I know You and Your  
Son whom You have sent

Hide not your face, good Father.  
You’ve made me holy.  
You will hear me when I call and  
You, I’ll surely see

The saints sing “Maranatha!”  
Let your kingdom come!  
We will soon behold the face of  
God’s begotten Son
