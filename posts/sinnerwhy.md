*How shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?*  
**Hebrews 2:3 (ESV)**

Sinner, why do you stand idly by?  
Judgment is coming, have you no fear?  
Quickly, to the cross of Jesus, fly!  
You won’t be cast out. Hurry, draw near!

“Oh, but I am too far gone,  
You do not know what I have done”  
Look, the God who knows of all your wrongs  
Has poured His wrath upon His holy Son!

Sinner, why do you so love the world?  
It’s temporary! Do you not know?  
Savior Jesus offers life eternal.  
Repent and believe! Give up and go!

“Why should I give up my life  
and live my days in poverty?”  
There are riches greater than this world’s  
This life you lose, but glory you will see.

Sinner, do not say that you have time.  
Are you all-knowing or immortal?  
Do not say you will repent in time.  
Suddenly appears the portal.

“Oh my Lord, was I not good enough?  
Look the things that I have collected”  
“Go away, I do not know you.  
Now you see that I am resurrected”
