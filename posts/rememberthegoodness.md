*The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness*  
**Exodus 34:6 (ESV)**

Remember the goodness of God  
His mercies never end.  
He’s lavished His blessings on us  
and still, there’s more to send.

Surrender your life to His will  
and His most holy rule.  
In Him there are riches forever  
and life forever full.

Remember the work of His Son,  
Eternal God in flesh.  
In Him, we are fully forgiven  
and death is put to death.

For sinners, the Son intercedes!  
He will carry us home.  
In Him we are fully secure,  
and never more to roam.

Remember the Spirit is here.  
To help us in our need.  
He’s given to us as a seal,  
and He will surely lead.

Be careful not to grieve your God.  
Respond in grateful praise.  
In Him we lift up our prayers  
and sing for all our days.
