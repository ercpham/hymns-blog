*All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out.*  
**John 20:6 (ESV)**

I can know of my salvation!  
God, how can this be?  
I am safe because my Savior  
ever pleads for me.

I can know of my salvation!  
There is none to fear.  
I cannot be separated,  
For God draws me near.

I can know of my salvation!  
He has told me how!  
He has worked in me obedience.  
At His throne, I bow.

I can know of my salvation!  
No one can accuse.  
Jesus said that it is finished.  
Life I cannot lose.
