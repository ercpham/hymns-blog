*It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.*  
**Luke 15:32 (ESV)**

Rebellious, I turned from my Father above.  
I wanted the world and rejected His love.  
Quickly I found myself deep in despair  
Suffering ‘cause I rejected His care

How could I have been so foolish and mad?  
And give up the blessings that I had once had?  
Now I desire the food of the trough  
I’ll be His servant, that will be enough

I do not deserve to be fully restored.  
I’m truly unworthy to look on my Lord.  
To bow at His feet, is all I desire.  
To be a son? I don’t dare to inquire

I go and return to my Master at home  
To possibly end my long aimless roam.  
But there on the road, who is it I see?  
It is my Father, running towards me!

I brace for a beating, but feel an embrace.  
I do not see anger, but marvelous grace!  
I thought it a dream, for he had just said,  
“Rejoice, for my son is no longer dead!
