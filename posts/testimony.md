*but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.*  
**Romans 5:8 (ESV)**

Verse 1:  
I’ve been running all my life.  
I’ve been running from Jesus Christ.  
I’ve been running all my life.  
From salvation for which he died.

Pre Chorus:  
You say I am chosen by You,  
How can this be?  
You say I am chosen by You  
A sinner like me

Chorus:  
You who parted the waters  
You who caused fire to  
rain from the skies

God of the universe,  
You showed Your love for us  
Through the death of Your son

Verse 2:  
I’ve been hiding from the light  
Sin exposed in a flash so bright  
Turned my blindness into sight  
Now my sin is like snow so white

Verse 3:  
By Spirit I’ve been reborn  
Christ in me, no longer forlorn  
Hope in life, eternity  
From my shackles I’ve been set free
