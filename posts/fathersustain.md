*Who among you fears the Lord and obeys the voice of his servant? Let him who walks in darkness and has no light trust in the name of the Lord and rely on his God.*  
**Isaiah 50:10 (ESV)**

Father, please sustain my soul.  
I've no strength inside myself.  
When I do not feel Your pull,  
hear my desperate cry for help.

Gloomy mist obscures my view,  
And I cannot see the end.  
Grant me faith, and courage too.  
Peace and comfort, quickly send.

I shall trust in You alone,  
even when the path is dark.  
You will bring me safely home.  
By Your Spirit, I am marked.
