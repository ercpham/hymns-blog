*...heaven, even highest heaven, cannot contain him*  
**2 Chronicles 2:6 (ESV)**

Holy and transcendent is  
the God who dwells on high  
He is uncontainable.  
His glory fills the skies.

They are foolish, who deny  
that God has made all things.  
Of His power, all the earth,  
with strength and fervor, sings.

Righteous and unchanging is  
the God who judges man.  
Justice shall be surely served  
by His own mighty hand.

Who does shake their fist against  
Our God, the only wise?  
Swiftly all their sins shall lead  
to ultimate demise.

Full of lovingkindness is  
the God so rich in love.  
Slow to anger, merciful,  
and far more than enough.

He has chosen us to be  
the objects of His grace.  
Of his glorious goodness all  
His people see and taste.

You have shown Yourself to us  
in Your eternal Son.  
We have found our righteousness  
in His pure, cleansing blood.

Truly, wrath and mercy are  
displayed upon the cross,  
where my Savior took my place  
and paid the weighty cost.
