*And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death*  
**Revelation 12:11 (ESV)**

This life I live, I do not love  
Death will bring me home.  
For Christ I bear my cross with joy.  
Soon, to Him, I’ll go.

My Savior’s blood was spilt for me!  
What have I to fear?  
His righteousness, and not my own:  
Of this, all men shall hear
