*The Lord says to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.”*  
**Psalm 110:1 (ESV)**

The long expected Son of God  
had come, but not to reign.  
Creator God had took on flesh  
to bear a creature’s pain

He suffered in Gethsemane  
and asked the cup to pass  
But He obeyed the Father’s will  
and drank that cup of wrath

See Him who dwelled in glory now  
receiving blows form man  
Delivered to a Roman cross  
and nailed by sinful hands

The King of Jews is crucified  
and mocked by those who see  
He lifted up His soul and said  
that He had paid the fee

But by death’s grip the God of life  
could never be constrained.  
The Son of Man is now alive  
and risen now to reign

Ascending to the Father’s throne  
He sat at His right hand  
He will return in glory to  
Bring judgment to this land
