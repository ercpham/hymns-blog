*Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.*  
**1 Corinthians 10:17 (ESV)**

Behold, His body, broken  
For all His church to share.  
The perfect bread from heaven,  
No earthly good compares.

Behold, the blood poured freely  
That we would be forgiven  
We drink the cup of blessing  
Because our Lord was smitten

We come to Him for filling  
and hunger never more.  
We never will be thirsty  
The fountain ever pours

Remember our good Savior  
Proclaim his death to all  
He shall return with fire  
and all will be in awe.
