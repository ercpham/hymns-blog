*...shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?*  
**John 18:11 (ESV)**

Rebellious and vile were we,  
Deserving of only Your fury  
But Christ, the Lord, has drunk the cup.  
Yes, He has drunken every drop!  
Now there is none left for me!

Your blessings and gifts we receive.  
There’s grace upon grace, and then more!  
For Christ has loved his helpless sheep,  
He saved the lost and lame and weak.  
The dead are being reborn!

Eternity waits for Your people.  
And it has already begun,  
For You have shown yourself to us!  
We know and love Your holy Son!  
The song we will sing, we’ll have sung
