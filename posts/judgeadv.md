*My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.*  
**1 John 2:1 (ESV)**

See how rulers tremble greatly  
at the sight of Jesus, Judge.  
Woe to them! the perfect standard  
of the Law will never budge.

Terrified as they behold the  
glory of the risen Lord,  
they are sent into the furnace  
where the fire ever roars.

See the hearts of sinners sinking  
when they see that great white throne.  
They are speechless as they realize  
By the judge they are not known

Oh, how sad, their vain defenses.  
Even sadder is their fate!  
There will be a river flowing,  
full of tears, from heaven’s gate.

How is it the saint rejoices  
at the sight of that same One?  
Why are they not filled with terror  
when they see the Holy Son?

Joyfully, the saints are bowing  
at the feet of their first love.  
Here’s the fruit of their believing.  
No more need to look above.

See this wondrous truth unfolding:  
He is Advocate and Judge!  
He who judges is the one who  
for His people shed His blood

Praise the Lord, the intercessor!  
He has brought His brethren home.  
They will reign with Savior Jesus.  
They are clean, and by Him known.
