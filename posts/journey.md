*And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night.*  
**Exodus 13:21 (ESV)**

I journey through a wilderness  
of danger, tears, and pain.  
For promises unseen I tread  
the rough and narrow way

In darkest night, I fix my eyes  
upon the pillar bright.  
My guide is ever Jesus Christ,  
the Savior and the light.

The desert, dry and desolate  
exhausts my well of strength  
Mirages captivate my heart,  
and thirst has made me faint.

But I am not without relief,  
for Jesus is the spring  
of living water and of grace.  
Salvation He shall bring

Though Egypt beckons my return,  
Though idols do entice,  
My hope is set upon the land  
of riches without price

When I arrive, I shall rejoice,  
for tears will be no more.  
My eyes shall soon behold the face  
of my most precious Lord.
