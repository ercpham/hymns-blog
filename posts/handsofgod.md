*And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.*  
**Philippians 1:6 (ESV)**

In the hands of God,  
I am safe for all my days.  
He will never let me go.  
He will keep me in the Way.

In the hands of God,  
I can know I am secure.  
For the Mighty cannot lie,  
And His promises are sure.

In the hands of God,  
Iâ€™ve no need to be afraid.  
He will never loose his grip  
For a debt already paid

In the hands of God,  
I am carried to the land  
Where there shall be no more sea,  
And the saints will be as sand
