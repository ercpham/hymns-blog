*Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever*  
**Hebrews 13:8 (ESV)**

Verse 1:  
You first called out to me, lit up the darkness  
I turned away from you, far did I run.  
Yet you were there with me. Love I can’t fathom.  
Your promises are true. You never change

Chorus:  
You are the same. Yesterday and today and forever.  

Verse 2:  
And in my wandering, you never left me  
Holy and merciful, wonderful God  
You knew I’d run from you, rebellious and prideful  
Still, you are faithful, for you never change

Verse 3:  
In the midst of my suffering, my strength depleted  
When I’m despairing of life itself  
Let me rely on You, God of deliverance  
On you my hope is set, for you never change

Verse 4:  
And in my final days, death will not fear me  
I have a hope in the King above  
When I arrive at home, into your presence  
It will be clear to me, you never change
