*For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.*  
**Romans 6:23 (ESV)**

I once walked in lawlessness,  
indulging in my sin.  
I stood condemned by God’s good law,  
with only death to win.

Though I walked the path of death,  
I had no heart to care  
Enslaved by passions of my flesh  
Of judgment, unaware

Then my eyes were opened to  
the evil of my deeds.  
Distraught and fearful, I became  
when I first saw my need!

Foolish were my vain attempts  
to justify myself.  
I could not cleanse my wicked heart  
and save myself from hell.

Ruined, I continued with  
the burden of my guilt,  
Until I trusted in the blood  
that my dear Savior spilt!

Mercy lifted off my weight.  
Free grace has set me free  
To walk in holiness and life  
and good works made for me!

Zealous I shall be for Christ,  
My Savior and my Lord!  
I’ll live and die for He who died  
and faces death no more!

He was brought to life again,  
so I am made alive!  
I am no longer as I was,  
for my old self has died.
