*For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd.*  
**Revelation 7:17 (ESV)**

While those around preserve their lives  
and labor for a worthless prize,  
I rest in Him who died for me,  
and die, that I might see the King.

Refrain:  
Look! The Lamb upon the throne.  
How beautiful is He!  
For my sins, He has atoned.  
His blood was shed for me!

The foolish one seeks vanity  
and stores up what he cannot keep.  
I wait for heaven’s great reward:  
That I might gaze upon my Lord

The one who seeks out worldly fame  
runs straight into the bitter flame  
I run that I’ll complete the race  
and one day see my Savior’s face.

Poor sinners on the brink of death  
should fear the day of final breath.  
The saint has held the Judge in view,  
but the condemned will see Him too.
