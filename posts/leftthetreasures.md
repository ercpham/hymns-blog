*For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison*  
**2 Corinthians 4:17 (ESV)**

I’ve left the treasures of this world  
To store up treasures I can’t see  
I’ve found the priceless, precious, pearl!  
Forever happy, I will be

There is no condemnation now.  
I only wait for glorious crowns  
To give to Him, to whom I’ll bow,  
Surrounded with angelic sounds

The base on which I build is Christ.  
Let not my works be burnt away!  
The hay and straw are gone from sight  
But precious stones and gold will stay

Let not my works be seen by men.  
The unknown saint, You will reward  
With glories that cannot be penned  
And riches kings could not afford
