*For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!”*  
**Romans 8:15 (ESV)**

God, you are my help  
When the darkness closes in  
Hear, when I cry out  
May Your Spirit speak within

Abba, Abba, Father  
Mighty God of love  
Turn my eyes to where You are  
Turn my eyes above

Lord, my sins are great.  
With iniquity I’m stained  
Yet, with blood I’m washed  
For the perfect Lamb was slain

Abba, Abba, Father  
Gracious, Merciful  
On the cross, my debt was paid  
It was paid in full

Father, I am scared  
That I will not reach the end  
Speak Your promises  
Lord, my soul, You will defend

Abba, Abba, Father  
Sovereign God of care  
Bring me home to where You are  
Bring me safely there

Soon, I shall be done  
With the race that I endure.  
So I run in faith  
For my crown and prize are sure

Abba, Abba, Father  
Faithful God of light  
Patiently I wait the day  
Faith is turned to sight
