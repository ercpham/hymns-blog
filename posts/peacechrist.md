*And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful.*  
**Colossians 3:15 (ESV)**

Oh, what peace and joy I have in Christ.  
Troubles and anxieties flee  
When I recall: from condemnation,  
sin, and fear of death, I’m free

Saint lift up your head to heav’n and see  
Glory, which our suffering brings  
The cost of life, yes, we have counted.  
Now with joy, we spend and sing

Be not sad and doubting precious one  
You are safe inside His arms  
His sovereign hand will bring us home and  
Keep His chosen ones from harm
