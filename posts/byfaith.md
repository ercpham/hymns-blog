*Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.*  
**Hebrews 11:1 (ESV)**

By faith, I trust in Christ,  
Who died for all my sins.  
United with the King, alive,  
I kill my sin within

By faith, I look above  
And not at things below.  
I look to where my Savior sits,  
For there, I soon, will go

By faith, I seek His face.  
He will reveal Himself.  
I will behold his glory soon  
And see Him for myself.

By faith, we wait for Him,  
Who is returning soon  
To gather up his chosen ones  
And raise them from their tombs
