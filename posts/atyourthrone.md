*Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of needverse here*  
**Hebrews 4:16 (ESV)**

At your throne of grace I fall.  
“Mercy, mercy!” I cry out.  
I’ve transgressed your holy law.  
Let me not slip into doubt.

Take away my sin and shame.  
Let me know I am forgiv’n  
I will suffer any pain,  
Let me know my home is heav’n

Sanctify and cleanse within  
Lord, I hate what you abhor  
I am not of Satan’s kin.  
I’ve walked through the narrow door.

Why, then, do I fail my King?  
Why, then, is my heart so cold?  
Lord, to you, I want to sing.  
Lord, for you, I must be bold.

But I shall not ever think  
That my labor brings me peace.  
If I do, then let me sink  
‘Til my pride and wisdom cease

Now, I raise a joyful song!  
I shall bow for all my days.  
I shall turn my eyes upon  
Christ, in whom, I see God’s grace.
