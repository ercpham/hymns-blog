*...that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish*  
**Ephesians 5:26-27 (ESV)**

Jesus, sanctify Your bride  
Wash Your church, for whom You died.  
Cleanse her from impurity  
Pure and spotless she will be

You have given her Your word  
You have called, and she has heard  
She has waited long for You,  
Jesus, show Your promise true

Clothe her with Your righteousness  
Sins, to You, she will confess  
Christ be faithful to forgive  
She’ll, with You, forever live

How she loves the thought of You!  
She, by faith, keeps You in view.  
Set her mind on rest above.  
Tell her of Your wondrous love!

Oh, what love You’ve shown to her!  
Blood has paid for debts incurred.  
You are the most faithful groom.  
She will not stay in the tomb.

She will rise to see Your face.  
Oh, the glory of that place!  
Heaven’s splendor is not gold.  
But the King, the Son of old
