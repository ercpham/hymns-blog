*In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.*  
**John 1:1 (ESV)**

The uncreated Son of God,  
creator of the world,  
stepped down from heaven’s heights and hid  
His glory held eternal.

The angels look in wonder as  
their God becomes a creature.  
They’re told to give the message of  
His birth to lowly shepherds.

Behold the Maker in the flesh!  
The Savior is a baby,  
yet no less worthy of our praise,  
and no less good and holy.

See how the Christ, omniscient one,  
is taught by other people!  
He learns and sleeps and grows and eats,  
our God, the Father’s equal

The perfect man is tempted in  
The wilderness He crafted  
He spoke the Scripture that He wrote;  
His spotlessness defended

The sinless one is on His knees  
To speak to God His Father  
He often slipped away to pray,  
A servant like no other

He humbly took on flesh for us,  
And sought to go down further.  
His suffering had been foretold  
He knew he would be murdered

The zealous one rebukes His Lord!  
He spoke without yet knowing.  
So forward to that fated day  
The righteous One keeps going.

He shares a supper even with  
The man that will betray Him  
The mighty God stoops down to wash  
The feet that will forsake Him

Behold the One Most Glorious  
Now pleading with His Father  
He wishes that the cup would pass  
Yet knows there is no Other

He sets His face to Calvary  
Where man will be forgiven  
He lets his hands and feet be bound,  
Into them, nails are driven

Upon the cross, the wrath of God  
Is poured upon the Savior  
That sinful men would only see  
The loving Father’s favor.

It pleased the Lord to crush His Son,  
To demonstrate His kindness  
The spotless lamb has shed His blood,  
To Him, He lifts His spirit

Rejoice! The Son has paid it all!  
At last we are forgiven!  
Eternal life is now secure  
For Jesus is now risen!
