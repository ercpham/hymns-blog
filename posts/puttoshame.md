*Wait for the Lord; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the Lord!*  
**Psalm 27:14 (ESV)**

Father, I am put to shame  
When I kneel down and call your name.  
I am cold and weak in prayer  
I have yet to shed a tear  
Lord, I wait for You  
Lord, I wait for You

God, I see your faithful saints  
Who wrestled and have seen your face.  
I desire such a zeal,  
And long for knowledge that is real.  
Lord, I wait for You  
Lord, I wait for You

Why do you not answer me?  
Do I not seek persistently?  
Why do you not hear my cry?  
Your self, I know I cannot buy.  
Lord, I wait for You  
Lord, I wait for You

Kneeling, I cry out for grace  
And let the old floor kiss my face  
Bowing, I breathe in the dust,  
For I seek you, I know I must  
Lord, I wait for You.  
Lord, I wait for You.

I am not content with me,  
So I will seek until I see  
Beauty, glory, majesty  
And all the fullness of my King.  
Lord, I wait for You.  
Lord, I wait for You.

Longing for a greater view,  
I look above and wait for You.  
Just a drop of heaven please.  
Itâ€™s you I want to know and see  
Lord, I wait for You  
Lord, I wait for You
