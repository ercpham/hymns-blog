*Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.*  
**Luke 8:39 (ESV)**

Everyone hear what the Lord has done!  
I have been saved by the Holy Son  
Shackles are broken, the prison door open  
With all my soul I shall swiftly run

I shall not fear nor be ashamed.  
I walk in the pow’r of Jesus’s name.  
He is salvation for all of the nations.  
Of Christ and His cross I proudly proclaim

Cause me to weep for unsaved souls.  
Father forgive me when I grow cold.  
Set me on fire. Fill me with your Spirit.  
I pray that I be more loving and bold

I live to hear those words: “Well done”.  
I’ll cast down my crown before the Son.  
I only do what I’ve been commanded  
Unworthy and grateful, I joyfully run
