*You who are of purer eyes than to see evil and cannot look at wrong*  
**Habakkuk 1:13 (ESV)**

Almighty, Sovereign, Infinite  
You are the God Most High  
The highest heavens are not fit  
in Your most holy sight

Your eyes are far too pure to look  
upon the sins of men.  
Their hearts are as an open book.  
In judgment, they won’t stand.

Your ordinances, always good  
Your judgments, ever fair.  
None, from You, can e’er elude,  
for You are always there

Your ears shall hear our endless praise.  
We’ll join the angels’ song.  
Great shouts of joy, we’ll ever raise  
We’ll worship all day long
