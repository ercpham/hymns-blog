*...the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, 46 who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.*  
**Matthew 13:45-46 (ESV)**

I once pursued the path of death  
yet feared the day of final breath.  
I stored up treasures on this earth  
I could not bring into the dirt

The only thing I stored was wrath.  
The way of sinners was my path  
I walked with them into the grave  
without a hope of being saved

But now I know the way of life  
For I have seen the Savior’s light  
Although I was already dead  
I died again to join the head!

The greatest treasure waits for me.  
It’s greater than all I can see  
I’ve sold it all to follow Him  
and gladly leave all of my kin
