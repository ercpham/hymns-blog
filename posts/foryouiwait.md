*...for you I wait all the day long.*  
**Psalm 25:5 (ESV)**

Father I knock at the door, please answer.  
Helpless, I wait. Give ear to my prayer.  
Please let me know you and feel Your presence.  
Give me emotion and full assurance.

I am so tired of life without feeling.  
God please control my heart and my singing.  
Never shall I be content without you.  
Let me not rest til I feel you anew.

I am the weakest of all Your people.  
Cold, without zeal, so often unfaithful  
Christ, on you, I am fully dependent  
More of You I desire each moment

Grant me persistence to pray without ceasing.  
Father I beg for Your power and healing.  
Heal me of apathy, open my eyes.  
Overwhelm me with Your glory divine.
