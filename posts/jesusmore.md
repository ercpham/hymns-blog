*Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.*  
**Matthew 13:44 (ESV)**

Jesus is more precious than the  
riches of the world to me.  
He is far more valuable than  
any thing the eye can see.  
I have given up my life and  
wait for my inheritance.  
My inheritance is Him, whose  
blood has paid for all my sins

Jesus is more beautiful than  
anyone that I can know.  
I have left my friends behind, for  
to his breast I long to go.  
Who has loved me with a love that’s  
greater than the love he’s shown?  
No one else has bought me, so I  
gladly sing “I’m not my own”

Jesus is more faithful than the  
most dependable on earth.  
He had seen my depths of sin, and  
still He chose to give me worth.  
Even when I wander from the  
one who’s given so much grace,  
He goes out to find me and  
assures me that I’ll see his face
