*...so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.*  
**Romans 3:26 (ESV)**

Who can stand before the Righteous God,  
To whom the heavens are not clean?  
Nations tremble at His voice and hide,  
but their iniquity is seen.

Holy God, your judgments never err.  
The wicked shall receive your wrath.  
On your day the sinner will be crushed  
and shall be trampled in your path

Loving God, your mercies never fail.  
You shower grace upon your sons.  
Undeserving sinners are forgiven!  
The vile, to your refuge, run.

Every evil criminal may come  
and look upon what God has done.  
He is holy, righteous, loving, kind,  
in sending us His only Son.

Jesus Christ has bought us with His blood,  
so God is righteous in His grace.  
He is just, and we are justified.  
In Him, we live, for we have faith.

None can boast, for all are saved by grace  
through faith that did not start with us.  
We were drawn by Him who loved His sheep  
‘Fore the creation of the dust

We will sing the song of grace until  
the day when you return with fire.  
We’ll remember we deserved the fate of  
the idolators and liars.
