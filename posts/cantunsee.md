*...looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.*  
**Hebrews 12:2 (ESV)**

I can’t unsee my Savior,  
who suffered on that tree.  
I shall not turn away from  
my Lord who died for me.  
My eyes are fixed upon the cross.  
For Him, I’ll suffer any loss.

I can’t unfeel the burden  
of all my sin and shame.  
I shall not be convicted,  
yet still remain the same.  
The Holy Ghost, He dwells in me!  
From bonds of sin, I’m surely free!

I can’t forget the glory  
that I am to receive.  
This world can’t attract me.  
Its pleasures won’t deceive  
My only joy is found in Christ  
who is Himself, eternal life
