*I am who I am*  
**Exodus 3:14 (ESV)**

Verse 1:  
Who has formed the universe,  
the canvas of his power?  
In six days he spoke it all to be.  

Whose wisdom is limitless?  
His knowledge knows no end!  
Glorious and unsearchable His ways!

Who, by space, is not contained?  
Not even by the heavens?  
Human hands could never hope to house!

Who is holy, holy, holy?  
Who demands our praises?  
Who will drive the nations to their knees?

Bridge:  
He is the One we call our Lord  
He is God and God alone!

Chorus:  
God you are the great “I Am”  
Almighty, good, and love  
You are a consuming fire  
Fearful, awesome, just

Maker of the universe  
Sustainer of our lives  
No one else deserves our praises  
None except the great “I Am”

Verse 2:  
Who is rich in grace and mercy?  
Who came down to Earth?  
Demonstrated love upon that cross?

Who by death is not defeated?  
Who has torn the veil?  
Who else sits and intercedes for me?
