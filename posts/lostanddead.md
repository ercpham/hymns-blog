*And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked*  
**Ephesians 2:1-2 (ESV)**

Verse 1:  
Lost and dead in all my sin  
Horrible and vile within,  
I deserved the wrath of God

All my works are filthy rags  
What hope could I poss’bly have?  
Look now, to the cross of Christ!

Refrain:  
Jesus Christ, my Savior is alive!  
Jesus Christ the perfect sacrifice  
Jesus Christ my Savior won’t forsake!  
From His love I’ll never separate

Verse 2:  
I have failed a hundred times  
I have done a thousand crimes  
How can there be hope for me?

Surely, he has left me now  
Do I await the Judge’s frown?  
No! Behold, the Savior’s grace!

Verse 3:  
Now I lay and wait to die  
Oh, but I have fear inside!  
What if I am self-deceived?

I shall trust in Christ alone  
For my sins, He has atoned  
I will surely wake and see
